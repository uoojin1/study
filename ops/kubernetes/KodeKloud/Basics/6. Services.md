# Services

In this lecture, we will discuss about Kubernetes Services.

## Services

Kubenetes Services enable communication between various components within and outside of the application. Kubernetes Services help us connect applications together with other applications or users. For example, our app has groups of pods running various sections, such as a group for serving front-end load to users, another group running backend processes, and a third group connecting to an external data source. It is `Services` that enable connectivity between these groups of pods. Services enable the front-end application to be made available to users, it helps communication between backend and frontend pods, and helps in establishing connectivity to an external data source. Thus, services enable loose coupling between microservices in our application.

Let's take a look at one usecase of Services. So far, we talked about how pods communicate with each other through internal networking. Let's look at some other aspects of networking in this lecture. Let's start with external communication. So we deployed our pod having a web app running on it. How do we (external user) acces the web page? First of all, let's look at the existing setup. The kubernetes node has an ip address of 192.168.1.2. My laptop is on the same network as well, so it has an IP 10.244.0.2. Clearly, I can't ping or access the pod at address 10.244.0.2 as its in a separate network. So what are the options to see the webpage?

First, if we were to SSH into the k9s node @ 192.168.1.2, from the node, we would be able to access the POD's webpage by doing a curl or if the node has a GUI, we could fire up a browser and see the webpage in a broswer following the address `http://10.244.0.2`. But this is from inside the kubernetes Node and that's not what I really want. I want to be able to access the webserver from my own laptop without having to ssh into the node and simply by accessing the ip of the kubernetes node. So we need something in the middle to help us map requests to the node from our laptop through the node to the pod running the web container.

That is where the kubernetes service comes into play. The kubernetes service is an object just like pods, replicaset, or deployments that we worked with before. One of its usecase is to listen to a port on the node and forward requests on that port to a port on the pod running the web application. This type of service is known as a `NodePort` service becuase the service listens to a port on the Node and forwards requests to pods. There are other kinds of servicees available which we will now discuss.
